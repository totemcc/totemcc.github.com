The ideas in this paper were explored during my time as a Masters' student at New York University's Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP). ITP is a multidisciplinary program which is part of NYU's art school but features a strong technology focus. Students come from diverse backgrounds: theater, sociology, law, philosophy, biology, industrial design, etc. Many enter the program with no prior computer programming experience, though they all leave with some.

Prior to ITP, I had professionally explored concepts from the academic programming languages community such as functional programming, functional reactive programming, and actor-based concurrency. Many of these concepts make programming simpler, yet by and large they are rejected by the mainstream programming community.

Largely this rejection is due to inertia. Our existing programming tools support certain programming paradigms. It makes sense to build new tools on existing tools, which reinforces support for these paradigms. But more subtly, because these are the programming tools that are available for beginner programmers, the programming community self-selects for people who naturally think in these paradigms.

New approaches to programming can attract unlikely programmers.


Many of my fellow students at ITP, while intelligent and resourceful, simply did not think in ways compatible with the ways we traditionally program computers. 









This incompatibility frustrated me on one level because creative visions might be unrealized or under-explored due to technical issues. And it frustrated me on another level because I feel that the act of programming can be the source for some of our deepest insights. Programming, when explored at its deepest levels, can induce ecstatic experiences--communion with the universe through computation. I want these insights and experiences to be available, in their own way, for everybody.
