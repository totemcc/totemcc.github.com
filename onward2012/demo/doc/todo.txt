Given that I'm dragging a shape, whose component list c0, c1, ..., cn I know,
  I'm going to be modifying c0.
    (This may make more modifications in a chain, because c0 may be repeated.)
  So, any shape that has c0 in its component list will change.
  Let's say my component list looks like: c0, c1, c2, c0, c1, c2, c4, c5
    Then I know that anything starting with c0, c1, c2, c0 will change *uniformly* with my manipulation







UI Essentials
  A way to do *no* iteration (to not get overwhelmed while editing)
  Drag reminder when you click primitive shapes
  Some sort of solution for the zoomed in/out too much to see anything problem (which now propagates because new definitions take the view from the last one)
  Some way to indicate that there's other stuff on the screen






Notion of selection
  For now, we'll have selection just be a componentPath (you can only select one shape)
  We'll show anything with the same c0 as dark red, the selected shape itself as bright red (as in mouseOver)
  mouseOver will trump selection on this display (i.e. if mouseOver, render that componentPath red rather than selection)
  
  To select:
    click a shape (click without drag)
  To unselect:
    click the background (click without drag)
  
  When something is selected, press delete to delete it (i.e. delete c0 from the focused definition)
  
  When something is selected, a scaling box will surround it with handles at the four corners and sides.
    Drag the handles to do scaling.
      Maybe hold shift (or whatever it is in PS) to scale uniformly.
      Will scaling keep center in place or opposite handle?
    Drag on edge (not handles) of the scaling box to rotate (without scaling)









When dragging definition in, use "local" coordinates to figure out where the definition was clicked
  Also compensate for zooming

Context menu
  Delete component
  Delete definition

Undo

Modifier keys/icons for:
  Scale only
  Rotate only
  Scale + rotate
  Translate


Keep on rendering past limits (during free cycles)...

Some way to indicate that primitive definitions can't be modified


Try out different interface
  Hold SHIFT to get resizing controls on every shape
  A way to only affect the C0
